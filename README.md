Tweaks for the Microsoft Band on Android.

## Main Features
It includes these features:

- Notification+ : Tile similar to the default Notification Center Tile but you can configure which apps are sending notifications to your band and which ones it should be ignored by the phone. It also include the full text of the notification and not only the title.

- Mail+: Tile similar to the default Mail Tile but you can choose which email app to use or if you want to use different email apps and then you are going to have the full notification and not only the subject as it happens with the default tile.

## Binary output
In the binary folder you are going to the find the latest build from the code. This is a very unstable build. It should not have any wrong behavior on your device but you should use it on your own behalf.
